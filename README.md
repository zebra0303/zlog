## 🌐 zlog: A Decentralized Community Network Beyond Personal Blogging

**"Maintain full data ownership while enjoying seamless community connectivity."**

zlog began with a simple, exciting vision: **"What if friends or hobbyist groups with shared interests could run their own blogs while subscribing to each other to build a collective feed together?"**

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94306fe1-211f-476b-aca3-90927c86af58" />

### 🤝 Personal Space, Shared Community

- **Co-created Networks**: While each person runs their own blog, you can connect specific categories to aggregate posts from like-minded peers right on your own dashboard.
- **Discovery through Flow**: Discover new zloggers through shared posts on your blog, and let your own content travel to others' feeds, inviting new audiences to your space.
- **Subscribe to Tastes**: If another zlogger loves your category, they can subscribe to it and integrate your latest updates into their own blog in real-time.

> "Where individual islands come together to form a continent—this is the decentralized blog network zlog envisions."

### The Problem: Personal Blogs as Isolated Islands

Personal blogs often become **"isolated islands."** No matter how great your content is, staying connected with peers or building a community usually requires moving into a "walled garden" (like Medium or Tumblr) or relying heavily on external tools like RSS readers and social media.

Centralized platforms offer connectivity at the cost of your data sovereignty and design freedom, while independent blogs offer freedom but suffer from isolation. **"Is it possible to maintain my own space while staying effortlessly connected with the people I care about?"** This is the question ZLOG aims to answer.

### The Solution: Your Blog, a Community Node

ZLOG transforms your blog into a **community node** by building subscription and federation right into the core engine. It creates a **"decentralized community network"** where independence and connectivity coexist.

1. **Co-created Community Feeds**: Friends or hobbyist groups can run their own independent blogs. By subscribing to each other's categories, your blog becomes a shared social dashboard for your circle.
2. **Discovery through Flow**: Your posts and subscribed posts from your peers live together in a single, unified feed. Visitors to your blog can naturally discover and jump to other amazing zloggers you follow.
3. **Sovereignty Meets Connectivity**: All these interactions happen on your own hardware (Mac Mini, Raspberry Pi, etc.). You maintain 100% ownership of your data and design while enjoying the benefits of a connected network.

Independent yet interconnected — a **decentralized blog network**. That's ZLOG.

## Core Feature: Subscription & Federation

This is what makes ZLOG unique. There are **two ways** to subscribe to a ZLOG blog:

        zlog[ZLOG-to-ZLOG Federation]

    subgraph rssFeatures [RSS Feed]

        percategory[Per-category Feeds]
        autodiscovery[Auto-discovery Support]
    end

    zlog --> zlogFeatures
    rss --> rssFeatures
```

### ZLOG-to-ZLOG Federation

When two ZLOG instances connect, they form a **live subscription** with automatic content delivery.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Blog A (Subscriber)
    participant BlogB as Blog B (Publisher)

    Note over Admin,BlogB: Phase 1 — Subscribe

    Admin->>BlogB: GET /api/federation/categories
    BlogB-->>Admin: List of public categories
    Admin->>BlogB: POST /api/federation/subscribe
    BlogB-->>Admin: Subscription confirmed
    Admin->>Admin: Store subscription mapping

    Note over Admin,BlogB: Phase 2 — Content Delivery (Automatic)

    BlogB->>BlogB: Author publishes a new post
    BlogB->>Admin: POST /api/federation/webhook
    Note right of BlogB: { event: "post.published",<br/>post: { title, content, ... } }
    Admin->>Admin: Store as remote post
    Admin->>Admin: Display in local category

    Note over Admin,BlogB: Phase 3 — Reader Experience

    Note over Admin: Visitor opens Blog A's category
    Admin->>Admin: Merge local + remote posts
    Note over Admin: Remote posts show "View Original"<br/>link back to Blog B
```

#### How It Works

1. **Subscribe**: From your admin dashboard, enter a remote blog URL, select a category to follow, and map it to one of your local categories. The subscription request is sent server-to-server (no CORS issues).

2. **Automatic Delivery**: When the publisher writes a new post, ZLOG sends a webhook to all subscribers. The post content (with properly resolved image URLs) is stored locally.

3. **Seamless Display**: Remote posts appear in your category listings alongside your own posts, sorted by date. Each remote post shows a "View Original" link to the source blog. Remote posts also appear in the "All" tab on the homepage.

4. **Background Sync**: A background worker automatically syncs all subscriptions periodically (default: every 15 minutes, configurable via `WEBHOOK_SYNC_INTERVAL`). This ensures no posts are missed even if webhooks fail. The worker uses incremental sync (`?since=lastSyncedAt`) for efficiency.

5. **Manual Sync**: You can also trigger a manual sync from the admin dashboard at any time to immediately fetch the latest posts.

### RSS Feed

Every ZLOG blog automatically generates RSS 2.0 feeds:

| Feed             | URL                        | Description                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Full Blog**    | `/rss.xml`                 | Latest 20 posts across all categories  |
| **Per Category** | `/category/{slug}/rss.xml` | Latest 20 posts in a specific category |

- **Auto-discovery**: `<link rel="alternate">` tag in HTML head for automatic detection by RSS readers
- **Standard format**: Compatible with Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, and any RSS 2.0 reader
- **RSS links** are visible in the sidebar and on each category page

### Admin Subscription Management

The admin dashboard provides a complete subscription management interface:

- **My Subscriptions**: View all categories you're subscribed to, with last sync time
- **Add Subscription**: Enter a remote blog URL → fetch categories → select & map to local category
- **Manual Sync**: One-click sync button to fetch latest posts from a subscription
- **Auto Sync**: Background worker syncs all subscriptions automatically (configurable interval)
- **Unsubscribe**: Remove subscriptions you no longer want
- **Subscriber List**: See which external blogs are subscribed to your categories
